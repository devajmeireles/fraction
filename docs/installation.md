# Installation

> Requires PHP 8.2+ and Laravel 11+

There is nothing special in its installation, just run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require fraction/fraction:^1.0
```

> _Fraction_ is not yet ready to be installed via _composer_.

After that, [you can start using the package in your Laravel application](using.md).
